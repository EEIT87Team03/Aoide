Lay your hands on me while I'm bleeding dry
Break on through blue skies, I'll take you higher

Caught up in circles
All dreams and bright lights
Wait I'm here always, brighter than sunshine

I fly
Fly out
Fly out to your heart
Fly out
Fly out

Lay your hands on me
Stay close by my side
Drive me so crazy　Moonlight and star shine

Faded into the setting sun
I'll see you again I'll carry on
Feeling like I'm floating leaves in the fleeting sky
you can sing that song

Let it go
move on
Let's go way out
Spaced out
Spaced out

Lay your hands on me stay close to my eyes
Drive me so crazy wake up in your arms
